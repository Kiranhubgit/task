      <p>Animated videos are videos created with original designs, drawings, illustrations or computer-generated effects that have been made to move in an eye-catching way using any number of artistic styles. Although they may integrate live action video, they donâ€™t require any live action recording to convey an idea or story.</p>
      <p>Many associate animated videos with fictional elements that craft a realistic story, but animated videos are not limited to that; they're multi-faceted</  p>
